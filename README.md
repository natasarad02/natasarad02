# Welcome ðŸŒ¹

## About Me

I'm a third-year student at the Faculty Of Technical Sciences in Novi Sad, mostly interested in artificial intelligence, web and mobile development. I also like to combine computer science and astrophysics.

## Programming languages

ðŸŒ™ Python <br>
ðŸŒ™ C/C++  <br>
ðŸŒ™ C#  <br>
ðŸŒ™ Java <br>
ðŸŒ™ HTML/CSS <br>

## Experience

I learned a lot of C, C++ and Java at college and a little bit of C# in high school. In Petnica, where I attended astronomy seminars, I got a lot of experience in Python (mainly data processing and calculations). I also participated in two machine learning Hackathons, where I became interested in artificial intelligence.
